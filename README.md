# Azure Function: HttpExample

This Azure Function, named `HttpExample`, is designed to handle HTTP trigger requests, process the data, and generate a personalized response.

## Description

The function is created as an HTTP-triggered function in Azure, allowing it to respond to both `GET` and `POST` requests. It retrieves the provided name from the query string or the request body to create a personalized greeting message. If no name is provided, it generates a default message instructing the user to input a name for a personalized response.

## Usage

To test the function, send an HTTP request using tools like cURL, Postman, or any HTTP client.

### HTTP Methods
- **GET**: To pass a name in the query string.
  Example: `https://your-function-url/api/HttpExample?name=John`
- **POST**: To pass a name in the request body.
  Example: Send a POST request with a JSON body like `{"name": "Jane"}`

## Function Logic

1. It logs the incoming request processing.
2. It extracts the name parameter from the query string or the request body.
3. Generates a response message based on the provided name.
4. Returns the response message as an `OkObjectResult`.
